// The page the site opens on. The row across the top stands around every page rather than
// belonging to this one, so it is the layout's and what is written here is only what is read
// under it. The column of links is left off this page by the route that draws it, since what the
// library holds is worth naming once the reader has been told what the library is.
//
// It is read down in one pass rather than looked up, so it is written as sections in the order a
// reader would come to them: what the library is, what its components are like to use, how far it
// has got, what gets built with it, who pays for it, who writes it, and last of all where it can be
// built. What comes out of the library is put after how far it has got and before the people, since
// a reader who has been told what it is and that it is used is asking what it is used for next. The
// first two of
// those are the opening's, since the claim and the components backing it are read as the one pass
// and are made together rather than a section apart; it hands them over loose, as the two boxes
// they are read as. The foot of the page stands under all of them, since what it holds is where the
// page can be left for rather than another thing it has to say. Each of them is held together by
// the page rather than holding itself apart, so the room between them and the room around them is
// given here and once, and it is that room alone that says where one has been finished with and the
// next has begun
