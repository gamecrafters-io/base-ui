// Every page the router can stand at a path, reached through the feature it belongs to rather
// than around it. They are written in the order the site is read in: the page it opens on, what
// has been built with the library, the one thing that has to be done first, the guides read
// through rather than looked up, the primitives everything else is drawn by, the components
// themselves, the Storybook they are developed and read in, and then what is answered with when a
// path names none of them
