## Getting Started

To use Base UI in an application, install the package and import its stylesheet. To work on the library itself, clone the repository and run Storybook.

### Installation

To use the library in an application:

1. Install the package
   ```sh
   npm install @gamecrafters/base-ui
   ```
2. Import the stylesheet once, at the root of the application
   ```js
   import '@gamecrafters/base-ui/main.css';
   ```

To work on the library itself:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gamecrafters-io/base-ui.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the docs and the site, where the components are developed and read
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Install the browsers the end to end suites are driven through, which is only needed once
   ```sh
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```
5. Working from a fork, change the git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to the base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your_username/base-ui.git
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```

## Usage

Wrap the application in a `ThemeProvider` so the tokens resolve, then reach for the components:

```jsx
import { Box, Button, FormControl, Stack, TextInput, ThemeProvider } from '@gamecrafters/base-ui/react';
import '@gamecrafters/base-ui/main.css';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider colorMode="auto">
    <Box padding="normal" background="muted" border="default" radius="medium">
      <Stack gap="normal">
        <FormControl required>
          <FormControl.Label>Name</FormControl.Label>
          <TextInput block />
          <FormControl.Caption>The name people will know you by</FormControl.Caption>
        </FormControl>
        <Button variant="primary">Save</Button>
      </Stack>
    </Box>
  </ThemeProvider>
);

export default App;
```

`colorMode` takes `day`, `night` or `auto`; `auto` follows the operating system. A nested `ThemeProvider` only has to say what it changes, so a subtree can hold a scheme of its own.

For a right-to-left subtree, wrap it in a `DirectionProvider`:

```jsx
import { DirectionProvider } from '@gamecrafters/base-ui/react';

<DirectionProvider direction="rtl">{children}</DirectionProvider>;
```

The code editor is the one component that asks for a step of its own. It is the Monaco editor,
whose language services run on web workers that only the application's bundler can place, so the
application says once, before any editor is shown, how each is started. With Vite, which bundles
a worker from an import ending in `?worker`:

```jsx
import { configureCodeEditorWorkers } from '@gamecrafters/base-ui/react';
import EditorWorker from 'monaco-editor/editor/editor.worker?worker';
import CssWorker from 'monaco-editor/languages/features/css/css.worker?worker';
import HtmlWorker from 'monaco-editor/languages/features/html/html.worker?worker';
import JsonWorker from 'monaco-editor/languages/features/json/json.worker?worker';
import TsWorker from 'monaco-editor/languages/features/typescript/ts.worker?worker';

configureCodeEditorWorkers({
  editor: () => new EditorWorker(),
  css: () => new CssWorker(),
  html: () => new HtmlWorker(),
  json: () => new JsonWorker(),
  typescript: () => new TsWorker(),
});
```

Without it the editor still edits and colours every language, and Monaco warns that it is running
the editor's own services on the main thread. An application that imports the workers lists
`monaco-editor` among its own dependencies as well.

The scripts are run from the root and reach the packages through Turbo, which caches a task
against its inputs so an unchanged package is not built or tested twice:

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Runs the docs and the site, on ports 3001 and 3000 |
| `npm test` | Runs the Vitest suites |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Runs the Playwright suites against Storybook |
| `npm run build` | Builds the package with Rolldown into `packages/react/build/` |
| `npm run build:docs` | Builds the static Storybook into `apps/docs/storybook-static/` |
| `npm run build:web` | Builds the site into `apps/web/build/` |
| `npm run lint` | Lints each package's own sources with ESLint |
| `npm run format` | Applies both the ESLint and Prettier fixes |
| `npm run clean` | Removes the build output |

Any one of them can be pointed at a single package instead, with `npm run build --workspace
@gamecrafters/base-ui`.

_Every component has a page in Storybook, with a Playground story for its props and a Features section for what it can do._

### The MCP server

The workspace also holds `@gamecrafters/base-ui-mcp`, a Model Context Protocol server that lets a
coding agent ask the design system what it holds rather than guess at it. Everything it answers is
read out of the library's own sources at the end of a build, so it says what the components were
written as rather than what was once written about them.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "base-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@gamecrafters/base-ui-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

| Tool | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `get_setup_guide` | What an application does once, before any component is written into it |
| `list_components` | Every component and provider the package exports |
| `get_component` | Every prop one of them takes, with what it is for and the values it takes |
| `get_component_examples` | The same component as it is already written, taken from its stories |
| `list_tokens` | The design tokens to reach for in place of a literal colour or measurement |

Working on the server itself, `npm run build --workspace @gamecrafters/base-ui-mcp` writes it and
its registry to `packages/mcp/build/`, which a client can be pointed straight at with `node`.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".
Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Run `npm run lint`, `npm test` and `npm run test:e2e`
4. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
5. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
6. Open a Pull Request

A new component follows the shape of the ones already there: a `ComponentName.tsx`, a `ComponentName.types.ts`, an `index.ts`, a Vitest suite and two Storybook files under `packages/react/src/components/<component-name>`, with its stylesheet under `packages/react/src/styles/components` and one line added to each of the two barrels.

A Vitest suite is where a component is held to what it draws and what it says, and it is what
every component carries. A Playwright suite under `e2e` is for the behaviour only a browser can
settle — where focus lands, what the top layer holds, what colour the cascade came out with —
and is added where a component has some.
